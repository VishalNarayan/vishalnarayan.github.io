</p>

<p>
<b>Overall vibe: hectic</b>
</p>

<p>
Definitely a very chaotic place and it was very loud. Our table was really sticky. The trivia was
conducted on phones again, using the same nyctrivialeague app that other trivia bars also use. I'm
undecided on whether or not I like using an app or slips of paper more, but I guess the app is
somewhat better for the environment. There was no AC or fans, which made it quite a stuffy area to
be in during this summer heat. We did not perform very well, landing in 11th or so place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The rounds I remember were:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Right-O": all the answers began with the letter "O"</li>
<li>List round: we had to list 8 of the 9 US capitals when sorted in alphabetical order</li>
<li>Party like it's 1999: the theme of the questions had something to do with 1999</li>
<li>Picture round: we had to name 10 of the longest running Broadway shows by their poster</li>
<li>Music round: each song had an article of clothing in its title. We had to name the artist.</li>
<li>Hold your horses: horses was the theme</li>
</ul>



<p>
<b>Food / Drinks:</b>
</p>

<p>
We did not order any food because everything looked a tad too expensive and probaby not a great !:$
ratio. We did, however, order a couple of Angry Orchards. Halfway through the session, we got a very
potent whiff of buffalo wings from another table, and were almost convinced to order some for
ourselves (not convinced enough to actually do it though).

<b>Attendees: myself, Ayushi, Sid, Kushal</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Overall vibe:</b>
</p>

<p>
Good vibes for sure. The trivia was conducted on our devices, rather than paper. I really liked the
announcer's vibe. He was very energetic, and went around the bar greeting everybody and introducing
himself and making sure everyone was having a good time. For lack of a better team name, I suggested
"She Cuban on my Missile til I Crisis" again, which seemed to be somewhat of a crowd favorite again.
</p>

<p>
The slate of questions was quite manageable this time around. We didn't feel too lost in the waters,
and were actually able to combine forces to answer most questions and hover in the top 3 places for
most of the contest. To be truthful, Kushal came in clutch with a lot of the answers, but the rest
of us did shine through in some particular questions. We ended up winning second place! Our reward
was a free round of drinks, which three of us thoroughly enjoyed (I won't mention who did not enjoy
their drink).
</p>

<p>
<b>The rounds I remember us doing were:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Back to School: the answers all had something to do with subjects in school</li>
<li>"G" Whiz: the answers all began with the letter "G"</li>
<li>Picture round: each picture featured a movie with the name "Shawn" or "Sean" or "Shaun", and we
had to identify it</li>
<li>Music round: we had to identify the artist, given a 30 second clip of the song. There were 8 songs
and each song had a number starting from 8 in descending order (like 4am by 2 Chainz and 3 Nights
by Dominic Fike)</li>
<li>Stars and Stripes: anything to do with stars or stripes</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Food / Drinks:</b>
</p>

<p>
The service was solid. We ordered truffle fries, fried pickles, and chips and guacamole. The truffle
fries were a solid 7 out of 10. They nailed the texture and the sauce, but they skimped us on the
truffle oil as I felt the fries did not have enough of that signature truffle scent and taste. The
fried pickles, although tasty, failed to meet the standards on texture as the breading was not
properly stuck to the pickles. These were the last to be finished. The chips and guacamole were
solid, and nothing bad could be said about them except for maybe that they should have given us more
quantity to enjoy for the price we paid. I would not come back here for the food, but it's not a bad
spot to enjoy a happy hour. And I would come back for the trivia.

<p>
<b>Overall vibe:</b>
</p>

<p>
Pretty solid vibe. There were about 5 rounds of questions, each with some bonus. I think the
questions were definitely catered to a Millenial crowd because there were a lot of pop culture
questions from the 20th century. If I remember correctly, one of the categories was 70s. The final
round was "recognize that tune", but aside from the Severance theme song every other tune they
played was an obscure tune from a not-very-well-known Play or TV Show from very long ago.
</p>

<p>
They did announce a "team name contest", subjectively chosen by the announcer, with the prize being
free shots. Dylan, having gotten there earlier than me and Kavya, named our team "She Cuban on my
Missile til I Crisis." Needless to say, we were the proud recipients of 3 free tequila shots. After
the contest, the announcer graciously took a shot with us. 
</p>


<p>
<b>Food / Drinks:</b>
</p>

<p>
The service was fairly slow, probably because there was just one waiter. Also the seats were not
super comfortable (only wooden everything, even benches). We were sat at a high top table. We
ordered some fries and tenders, paying roughly ~15 for each. The food itself wasn't anything to
write home about, and might have been good sustenance food for a drunken night out. At first, the
beer I ordered arrived at room temperature, which prompted us to switch it out for a different
colder one which I'd rate a 6 out of 10 on taste.
