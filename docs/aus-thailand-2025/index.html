<p>
After getting through security, we wandered around a few lounges. Most were unimpressive, but one
served a surprisingly good penne arrabbiata. 🍝
</p>

<p>
We spent too much time hanging out and ended up boarding at last call. It actually worked out since
we didn't have to wait in any lines.
</p>

<p>
While we were sat in aisles, both of us ended up next to very large people. Shivaum got stuck beside
a 250+ lb man who snored with a wide-open mouth the entire flight, forcing him to wear AirPods and
blast music to fall asleep. I still managed to sleep for about seven of the ten hours.
</p>

<p>
When we landed in Fiji, we tried to get into a lounge using Priority Pass. They sent us away at
first, but eventually let us in. Breakfast ended up being amazing — fried rice with soy and chili
oils, crispy hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, coconut jelly, Greek yogurt, and an iced coffee so good I
had two.

<p>
At customs, I had to declare my trail mix, but they waved me through. Shivaum had his bag sniffed by
dogs, but he was eventually cleared too. 🐕
</p>

<p>
We Ubered to Neil’s apartment, and then went out to a Japanese restaurant for salmon, other fish,
edamame, rice, chicken, and gyoza.
</p>

<p>
We got a coffee on our way back to the apartment and watched some YouTube videos before heading to
the pool. Neil swam like a triathlete (because he was training for one). I flailed around and
decided I needed to start swimming more. 🏊🏾‍♂️ After the hot tub and a shower, we headed out for dinner.

<p>
We ate at an Italian spot called <a href="https://share.google/SYsx4kKvmaBluMR4D">Vici</a> on Gray Street. Palomas turned out to be a bad choice cus
tequila and Italian food don't mix. The chicken parm was dry, so I asked for marinara sauce. At
first the waitress misheard me as saying "mayonnaise" and couldn't understand what I wanted. I tried
clarifying my request by asking for "tomato sauce", which she seemed to understand. Finally, she
brought me ketchup. At least the three-cheese pizza was good. 🍕
</p>

<p>
After dinner we tried going to a famous ice cream shop, but the line was ridiculous. Instead, we
picked up a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s Half Baked at 7-Eleven. 🍨
</p>

<p>
Back at the apartment, we planned to watch Transformers, but Shivaum and I passed out immediately. G
arrived. 💤

In the morning, we Ubered about an hour and a half to the Gold Coast. On the way, we stopped at <a href="https://share.google/iTkW2UhfrDFDzUG0I">Kefi

We walked around Surfers Paradise beach before grabbing Lime bikes. With a Spotify jam session going
in our AirPods, biking along the coast felt magical. 🚲🎧

Our Airbnb was too far to reach by bike, so we Ubered the rest of the way. The place was spacious
and luxurious, with a beautiful view and a pool.

<p>
We swam for a while, but a group of boisterous middle-aged Indian men set off the panic alarm in the
hot tub, which went off for ages. 🚨
</p>

<p>
After showering, Neil’s friend Brayden joined us, and we opened wine and acquainted. 🍷
</p>

<p>
Dinner was at <a href="https://share.google/BNCZmoqvlZQj2xHYL">Costa Taco</a>, which was surprisingly solid. I even finessed a free margarita. 🌮🍸
</p>

<p>
We went clubbing afterward, and it turned out to be one of the best clubs I’d ever been to. The DJ
played house and dance-y remixes of popular songs, and transitioned beautifully. It did feel a tad
like an influencer central, but the music was god-tier and people were friendly.

We woke up to an incredible ocean view. Neil had already gone on a run, but we walked the beach
together upon his return. 🌊

<p>
For breakfast we had GYG (Guzman y Gomez) burritos 🌯. We followed it with coffee and pastries from a

<p>
While waiting for Varun and Akhil, whose flight was delayed, Neil, Shiv, and I went for a 5k run. I
struggled during it, but felt good afterward. 🏃🏾
</p>

<p>
Once Varun and Akhil arrived, we all went for lunch at a Mediterranean restaurant. The food and
vibes were great.

We tested out the pool which felt like a cold plunge, and the hot tub which, unfortunately, didn’t

That evening, we pregamed while playing Annihilation. The drinks loosened our tongues and set our
heads afloat. 🏮

<p>
Afterward, we went to a bar where I made up a card game to decide who bought the next round. Akhil
lost and had to pay.
</p>

<p>
We went clubbing afterward. <a href="https://share.google/pnM55vj0Ju0z9FALG">Maya</a>, a rooftop bar, was fun, but <a href="https://share.google/eOPEMsGcuzhXSentr">Tax Office</a> was disappointing after a
long line and a $20 cover for Neil and Akhil. We eventually went back to Maya.
</p>

<p>
Varun and Gaurav left early, but the rest of us stayed out until around 2–3 AM.

<p>
We woke up naturally and walked 30 minutes to the Botanical Garden. On the way, we stopped at a food
market, where I got a pain au raisin and a lemongrass chicken banh mi.
</p>

<p>
We ate sitting on the grass in the garden and then found a café nearby. I had an iced mocha, which
wasn’t very sweet but still good.
</p>

<p>
We headed home briefly so everyone could take bathroom breaks, and then Ubered to the <a href="https://share.google/fFEw2ety3iQbvbrmJ">Koala
Sanctuary</a>.
</p>

<p>
The sanctuary started with a sheepdog herding show, then we saw wombats, koalas, cassowaries,
crocodiles, snakes, lizards, and even a platypus.
</p>

<p>
The highlight was the kangaroo field. We petted kangaroos and emus, and saw a pregnant kangaroo with
a joey’s leg sticking out.

<p>
Before leaving, I bought some souvenirs, and Neil introduced me to Golden Gaytime ice cream, which
was so gas I went back and bought one for myself.
</p>

<p>
On the Uber ride back, the driver had a big personality, joking about his AI assistant “Patricia.”
</p>

<p>
We stopped at an outdoor mall for food: I had a sushi roll and chicken tenders at Betty’s Burgers,
while others grabbed burgers. After, we all hit Krispy Kreme.
</p>

<p>
Back at Neil’s, we swam again, played chickenfight in the pool, and sat in the Jacuzzi and
sauna. Varun and Shivaum were quite the formiddable chickenfight duo.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was at a ramen shop. I wasn't a huge fan of my miso ramen but the appetizers were nice. 🍜
</p>

<p>
Back at the apartment, we played Codenames, which ended evenly. I wound down watching weaving videos
before falling asleep.

</p>

<p>
Our first stop was McDonald’s for breakfast: hashbrowns, a chicken McMuffin, apple slices, apple
pie, and an iced vanilla latte for myself.
</p>

<p>
We drove to Noosa National Park, which turned out to be perfect. The water was warm, the sand was
soft, and we body-surfed and lounged for hours.

<p>
During the drive, we played road trip games like What Passes Through the
Gate, Lateral Thinking Scenarios, Contact, Wavelengths, and made up stories.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was Japanese BBQ, which was really good, though it was a long drive to get there.
</p>

<p>
After a quick stop at Neil’s, we went back to the Airbnb and celebrated Neil’s birthday with a sour
cream cake that was meant as a meme but actually tasted pretty good.

After dinner, we went to the casino. Several of us put $100 on black, and it hit 🤑, which paid for
part of dinner (RIP Sai 🪦). We played a little blackjack and left while we were ahead.

<p>
Back at Neil’s, Sai introduced us to a card game called Literature, which turned out to be a lot of
fun. After an hour of that, we returned to the Airbnb and crashed.

an egg tart, a cinnamon roll, a German pineapple pastry, and an egg-and-cheese or mushroom Danish
that was especially good. I had an iced latte, which was just okay. 🥮
</p>

<p>
We walked to exchange money and picked up some cash, and then went back to the hostel for jackets
because of the heavy rain. Twas monsoon season, so when it rained it poured.
</p>

<p>
We grabbed a scooter ride and then took a boat to the <a href="https://share.google/07egdoojjHMaGjOFX">Grand Palace</a>. Bought some traditional pants
outside because they wouldn't let us in wearing shorts. Walked through the palace, which was

<p>
After a briefing, coffee, and a snack, we boarded the boat. The weather was rough, so we couldn’t
visit Maya Bay. It was stormy, and my makeshift hat kept flying off.

mangroves, the sea, and a river in the rain, which made the scenery feel even more lush and
atmospheric.

<p>
I shared a boat with Varun while the others paired up. The trip was a highlight of the day.

<p>
After lunch at <a href="https://share.google/oDu7rJrxBQEnsuipy">Burger Daddy</a> (pizza + burgers, tasty but greasy), I tried getting a haircut. The
barber rushed and even cut my lip while shaving me, which was frustrating.
</p>

<p>
Later, I looked for a spa, eventually ending up at Radarom Spa for a manicure and pedicure that
lasted ~1.5 hours.
</p>

<p>
After relaxing at the villa, I joined Varun and Akhil for an evening out. We tried to see a fire
show at Ao Nang Beach, but it wasn’t happening. Instead, we shopped a bit, bought passport covers,
and then went for massages.
</p>

<p>
By the time we finished it was 10 PM and most places were closed. We ended up back at Burger Daddy,
grabbed a couple pizzas, and ate them at the villa before packing and sleeping.

We caught an early morning flight to Chiang Mai, which was mostly empty.
</p>

<p>
From the airport, we went straight to a <a href="https://share.google/yTtIBMYHwPy2jfPOp">Michelin-starred restaurant</a> that had kept its star for seven
years. The khao soi was good, but the other curries were disappointing. I personally don't know how
that restaurant consistently kept the star.

We crossed the street to a café for coconut lattes. When we tried to play cards, the staff stopped
us, explaining that card games are considered gambling in Thailand.
</p>

<p>
Our Airbnb was very nice, with two adjoining houses. We relaxed, played Literature, and then headed
out.

at nearby shops instead.

In the evening, we went to a market to meet our instructor for the cooking class. After a short tour
of the food stalls, we went to the cooking school, which was pleasantly set in the middle of a large
expanse of fields.

I spent most of the day browsing stones. One seller quoted suspiciously low prices for "real"

Kavya, and a few loose stones.

<p>
By the time I finished shopping, it was late. I quickly exchanged money and tried to pick up
souvenirs but ran out of time.

The ride to the airport was long, and even there I could not find anything worth buying.
