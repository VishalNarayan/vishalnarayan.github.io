| Nf3  | Nc6  |                                                                                                                                             |
| d4   | exd4 |                                                                                                                                             |
| Nxd4 |      | Here, black can continue with Nf6 or Bc5.                                                                                                   |
|      | Bc5  | White can continue with Be3, Nb3, or Nxc6                                                                                                   |
| Be3  | Qf6  | Here, Qf6 is a good system, with Ne7 following. Another move is Bb6. At this point if Nxc6, then Bxe3 threatens mate and is good for black. |
|      |      |                                                                                                                                             |
