| Nf3  | Nc6  |                                                                                                                                             |
| d4   | exd4 |                                                                                                                                             |
| Nxd4 |      | Here, black can continue with Nf6 or Bc5.                                                                                                   |
|      | Bc5  | White can continue with Be3, Nb3, or Nxc6                                                                                                   |
| Be3  | Qf6  | Here, Qf6 is a good system, with Ne7 following. Another move is Bb6. At this point if Nxc6, then Bxe3 threatens mate and is good for black. |
|      |      |                                                                                                                                             |

| Qf3  | Nf6  |                          |
| Be3  | 0-0  |                          |
| Bd3  | Re8  |                          |
| 0-0  |      | and here, white is fine. |

Alternatively,
4.. exd4
5. [@5] Nxd4 Nxd4 is a mistake.
6. Qxd4


Once the queen enters the center white has a lot of control.
Here, d6 is necessary to stop e5.

Lots of people play c5 trying to attack the queen, but Qa4 prevents d6 and prepares e5.
Can put the light squared bishop on c4 (e4 pawn is defended well enough).
If no squares are appealing, can even fianchetto the bishop.


** 1. e4 c5
