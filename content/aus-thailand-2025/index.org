*  Australia Thailand Trip with the Boys

** 🇦🇺 Australia
*** ✈️ July 31 — Flight & Arrival 

After getting through security, we wandered around a few lounges. Most were unimpressive, but one
served a surprisingly good penne arrabbiata. 🍝

We spent too much time hanging out and ended up boarding at last call. It actually worked out since
we didn't have to wait in any lines.
    
While we were sat in aisles, both of us ended up next to very large people. Shivaum got stuck beside
a 250+ lb man who snored with a wide-open mouth the entire flight, forcing him to wear AirPods and
blast music to fall asleep. I still managed to sleep for about seven of the ten hours.
    
When we landed in Fiji, we tried to get into a lounge using Priority Pass. They sent us away at
first, but eventually let us in. Breakfast ended up being amazing — fried rice with soy and chili
oils, crispy hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, coconut jelly, Greek yogurt, and an iced coffee so good I
had two.

At customs, I had to declare my trail mix, but they waved me through. Shivaum had his bag sniffed by
dogs, but he was eventually cleared too. 🐕
    
We Ubered to Neil’s apartment, and then went out to a Japanese restaurant for salmon, other fish,
edamame, rice, chicken, and gyoza.

We got a coffee on our way back to the apartment and watched some YouTube videos before heading to
the pool. Neil swam like a triathlete (because he was training for one). I flailed around and
decided I needed to start swimming more. 🏊🏾‍♂️ After the hot tub and a shower, we headed out for dinner.

We ate at an Italian spot called [[https://share.google/SYsx4kKvmaBluMR4D][Vici]] on Gray Street. Palomas turned out to be a bad choice cus
tequila and Italian food don't mix. The chicken parm was dry, so I asked for marinara sauce. At
first the waitress misheard me as saying "mayonnaise" and couldn't understand what I wanted. I tried
clarifying my request by asking for "tomato sauce", which she seemed to understand. Finally, she
brought me ketchup. At least the three-cheese pizza was good. 🍕
    
After dinner we tried going to a famous ice cream shop, but the line was ridiculous. Instead, we
picked up a pint of Ben & Jerry’s Half Baked at 7-Eleven. 🍨
    
Back at the apartment, we planned to watch Transformers, but Shivaum and I passed out immediately. G
arrived. 💤

*** 🌊 August 1 — Gold Coast

In a show of authentic Australian hospitality, Neil woke me up with some vegemite. 🤢🥴
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300px :style display:block; margin:0 auto; text-align:center;
[[file:pics/aus/vegemite.webp]]

In the morning, we Ubered about an hour and a half to the Gold Coast. On the way, we stopped at [[https://share.google/iTkW2UhfrDFDzUG0I][Kefi
Café]] and had chicken shawarma platters with chai. 🍛🫖

We walked around Surfers Paradise beach before grabbing Lime bikes. With a Spotify jam session going
in our AirPods, biking along the coast felt magical. 🚲🎧

and luxurious, with a beautiful view and a pool.

We swam for a while, but a group of boisterous middle-aged Indian men set off the panic alarm in the
hot tub, which went off for ages. 🚨

After showering, Neil’s friend Brayden joined us, and we opened wine and acquainted. 🍷
    
Dinner was at [[https://share.google/BNCZmoqvlZQj2xHYL][Costa Taco]], which was surprisingly solid. I even finessed a free margarita. 🌮🍸
    
We went clubbing afterward, and it turned out to be one of the best clubs I’d ever been to. The DJ
played house and dance-y remixes of popular songs, and transitioned beautifully. It did feel a tad
like an influencer central, but the music was god-tier and people were friendly.

After a couple drinks and some dancing, we made it back to the Airbnb before midnight and knocked
out.

*** 🌅 August 2 — Back to Brisbane 

We woke up to an incredible ocean view. Neil had already gone on a run, but we walked the beach
together upon his return. 🌊
    
For breakfast we had GYG (Guzman y Gomez) burritos 🌯. We followed it with coffee and pastries from a
café. ☕️🥐

After packing up, we took a public train back to Brisbane.
    
While waiting for Varun and Akhil, whose flight was delayed, Neil, Shiv, and I went for a 5k run. I
struggled during it, but felt good afterward. 🏃🏾
    
Once Varun and Akhil arrived, we all went for lunch at a Mediterranean restaurant. The food and
vibes were great.

Later, we moved into a new Airbnb near Neil’s hotel. It was comfortable, with a nice view. However,
to our disappointment, the Wi-Fi was on PTO for the duration of our stay. ❌🛜

We tested out the pool which felt like a cold plunge, and the hot tub which, unfortunately, didn’t
heat well. I kept switching between the two.🔥🧊
    
That evening, we pregamed while playing Annihilation. The drinks loosened our tongues and set our
heads afloat. 🏮

Afterward, we went to a bar where I made up a card game to decide who bought the next round. Akhil
lost and had to pay.
    
We went clubbing afterward. [[https://share.google/pnM55vj0Ju0z9FALG][Maya]], a rooftop bar, was fun, but [[https://share.google/eOPEMsGcuzhXSentr][Tax Office]] was disappointing after a
long line and a $20 cover for Neil and Akhil. We eventually went back to Maya.
    
Varun and Gaurav left early, but the rest of us stayed out until around 2–3 AM.

*** 🌿 August 3 — Koalas, Kangaroos & Ramen 

We woke up naturally and walked 30 minutes to the Botanical Garden. On the way, we stopped at a food
market, where I got a pain au raisin and a lemongrass chicken banh mi.
    
We ate sitting on the grass in the garden and then found a café nearby. I had an iced mocha, which
wasn’t very sweet but still good.
    
We headed home briefly so everyone could take bathroom breaks, and then Ubered to the [[https://share.google/fFEw2ety3iQbvbrmJ][Koala
Sanctuary]].
    
The sanctuary started with a sheepdog herding show, then we saw wombats, koalas, cassowaries,
crocodiles, snakes, lizards, and even a platypus.
    
The highlight was the kangaroo field. We petted kangaroos and emus, and saw a pregnant kangaroo with
a joey’s leg sticking out.

Before leaving, I bought some souvenirs, and Neil introduced me to Golden Gaytime ice cream, which
was so gas I went back and bought one for myself.
    
On the Uber ride back, the driver had a big personality, joking about his AI assistant “Patricia.”
    
We stopped at an outdoor mall for food: I had a sushi roll and chicken tenders at Betty’s Burgers,
while others grabbed burgers. After, we all hit Krispy Kreme.
    
Back at Neil’s, we swam again, played chickenfight in the pool, and sat in the Jacuzzi and
sauna. Varun and Shivaum were quite the formiddable chickenfight duo.

Dinner was at a ramen shop. I wasn't a huge fan of my miso ramen but the appetizers were nice. 🍜
    
Back at the apartment, we played Codenames, which ended evenly. I wound down watching weaving videos
before falling asleep.

*** 🏖️ August 4 — Noosa + Neil’s Birthday

Varun and Gaurav picked up the car while the rest of us packed for a beach day.
    
Our first stop was McDonald’s for breakfast: hashbrowns, a chicken McMuffin, apple slices, apple
pie, and an iced vanilla latte for myself.
    
We drove to Noosa National Park, which turned out to be perfect. The water was warm, the sand was
soft, and we body-surfed and lounged for hours.

We lost track of Varun and Akhil for a while, but eventually regrouped at the car.
    
From there, we drove to the Sunshine Coast to catch the sunset, which was beautiful.

During the drive, we played road trip games like What Passes Through the
Gate, Lateral Thinking Scenarios, Contact, Wavelengths, and made up stories.
    
Dinner was Japanese BBQ, which was really good, though it was a long drive to get there.
    
After a quick stop at Neil’s, we went back to the Airbnb and celebrated Neil’s birthday with a sour
cream cake that was meant as a meme but actually tasted pretty good.

In the morning, I joined Shiv at [[https://share.google/5MMX7WrqiAtUbDbw8][L’Americano café]], where I had an iced mocha and a biscuit.

We stopped at [[https://share.google/SVWBKlQf50HrIIn6K][Sarni]] café for sandwiches and hard lemonade. The sandwiches were horrible, but the
ride itself was fun.
    
We Ubered to Neil’s and walked over to the [[https://share.google/C46yjKfehWmyAIA0K][Queensland Museum]], hoping to see Aboriginal
history. Instead, we found a huge exhibit on Ancient Egypt, which felt completely out of place.

Back at Neil’s, Sai introduced us to a card game called Literature, which turned out to be a lot of
fun. After an hour of that, we returned to the Airbnb and crashed.

We ate at [[https://share.google/sWm795OdP9X0Ald2M][G’s]] German and Thai food, where we ordered Panang curry, Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, green
curry, and papaya salad. The food was pretty good.

Afterward, we walked through the market area, where there were many ping-pong shows being
advertised. None of them were able to reel us in though.

We stopped at a convenience store to pick up a few things, then went back to the hostel and fell
asleep.

*** 🌞 Thursday, August 7 — Temples 

We took a shower and walked to [[https://share.google/ZPA3ZOqF7vD3ZwQqO][La Cabra]] for breakfast. We tried several pastries: spinach and egg,
an egg tart, a cinnamon roll, a German pineapple pastry, and an egg-and-cheese or mushroom Danish
that was especially good. I had an iced latte, which was just okay. 🥮

We walked to exchange money and picked up some cash, and then went back to the hostel for jackets
because of the heavy rain. Twas monsoon season, so when it rained it poured.
    
We grabbed a scooter ride and then took a boat to the [[https://share.google/07egdoojjHMaGjOFX][Grand Palace]]. Bought some traditional pants
outside because they wouldn't let us in wearing shorts. Walked through the palace, which was
beautiful but hot, humid, and packed with tourists. We all sat down to pray for a bit. 🙏🏾

hell.

burgers, tikka masala, and more. My cocktail was awful, though their espresso martinis were better.
    
We were all gassed, so we walked around briefly, took motorbikes back, and crashed.


*** 🥘 Friday, August 8 — To Krabi

In the morning, we packed up, showered, and walked through [[https://share.google/4dkVIxU4EuDGZj6Hd][Lumphini Park]] to arrive at [[https://share.google/5KCoxAPdg77wqYPEe][Allo House]]
cafe, a hidden gem with a garden.

There, we ordered chicken cappellini, pancakes, eggs, and a soft omelet that was excellent. We also
had coffee floats with pistachio and Thai tea ice cream, and I ordered a Thai iced coffee, which was
very good. We shared some fried chicken that was juicy and tender.

basically a courtyard with a large swimming pool in the middle, surrounded by each bedroom and the

*** 🌴 Saturday, August 9 — Phi Phi Islands Excursion

We woke up early and got picked up by bus for a full-day excursion to the [[https://share.google/Ys3rO3PbC3qdNhnyA][Phi Phi Islands]]. The bus
was packed like a cargo van.
    
After a briefing, coffee, and a snack, we boarded the boat. The weather was rough, so we couldn’t
visit Maya Bay. It was stormy, and my makeshift hat kept flying off.
    
Our first stop was at a lagoon, where we had an incredible swim in calm, beautiful water.

We attempted snorkeling at another location, but the waves were too strong and visibility was poor.
    
By the time we reached the island for lunch, I was nauseous, so I barely ate, but what I had was
good.
    
We walked around the island briefly before heading back. On the return trip, the water had calmed,
and the snorkeling was much better.

After returning to the villa for a quick rest, we went to get proper Thai massages at [[https://share.google/RRTQNAZ2ucCpb9wzR][Momiji
Onsen]]. Mine was intense and she cracked my back like bubble wrap. 💆🏾
    
For dinner, we went to an Indian restaurant recommended by Neil. The food was excellent, though we
ordered far too much. The mango lassi stood out as especially good.

We woke up at a reasonable time, had breakfast, then headed out to [[https://share.google/ucUs63KsIOqmbGA7K][Tiger Cave Temple]]. The climb was
1,200 steps and left us gassed, but the views were worth it.

We returned home, played cards, and went to sleep.


*** 🚣 Monday, August 11 — Kayaking & Spa Day

We started the day with a kayaking excursion that was an hour’s drive away. We paddled through
mangroves, the sea, and a river in the rain, which made the scenery feel even more lush and
atmospheric.

After lunch at [[https://share.google/oDu7rJrxBQEnsuipy][Burger Daddy]] (pizza + burgers, tasty but greasy), I tried getting a haircut. The
barber rushed and even cut my lip while shaving me, which was frustrating.
    
Later, I looked for a spa, eventually ending up at Radarom Spa for a manicure and pedicure that
lasted ~1.5 hours.
    
After relaxing at the villa, I joined Varun and Akhil for an evening out. We tried to see a fire
show at Ao Nang Beach, but it wasn’t happening. Instead, we shopped a bit, bought passport covers,
and then went for massages.
    
By the time we finished it was 10 PM and most places were closed. We ended up back at Burger Daddy,
grabbed a couple pizzas, and ate them at the villa before packing and sleeping.


*** ✈️ Tuesday, August 12 — To Chiang Mai

We caught an early morning flight to Chiang Mai, which was mostly empty.
    
From the airport, we went straight to a [[https://share.google/yTtIBMYHwPy2jfPOp][Michelin-starred restaurant]] that had kept its star for seven
years. The khao soi was good, but the other curries were disappointing. I personally don't know how
that restaurant consistently kept the star.

us, explaining that card games are considered gambling in Thailand.

/Last brunch in Thailand/

I spent most of the day browsing stones. One seller quoted suspiciously low prices for "real"
rubies, so I passed. Eventually, I bought a jade earring and necklace set for Zahra, a pendant for
Kavya, and a few loose stones.

By the time I finished shopping, it was late. I quickly exchanged money and tried to pick up
souvenirs but ran out of time.

The ride to the airport was long, and even there I could not find anything worth buying.
    
I had a quick dinner in the lounge and then boarded my flight. The flight was comfortable, and after
a connection, I finally arrived home. 🏡
