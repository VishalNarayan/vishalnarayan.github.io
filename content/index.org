** About Me

Greetings! I'm Vishal Narayan, a software engineer at Amazon Prime Video. I graduated from UCLA in 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science.

#+HTML: <p>I've created this site as my personal corner of the internet -- a place to share projects, notes, thoughts, recipes, music, <b><i><a href="javascript:void(0)" id="randomPhrase" class="clickable">and anything else that resists categorization</a></i></b>. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
