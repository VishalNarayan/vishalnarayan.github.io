** About Me

Greetings! I'm Vishal Narayan, a software engineer at Amazon Prime Video. I graduated from UCLA in 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science.

I've created this site as my personal corner of the internet -- a place to share projects, notes, thoughts, recipes, music, and anything else that resists categorization. Thanks for stopping by!
