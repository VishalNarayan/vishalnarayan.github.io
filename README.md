This is the [website](https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/building-the-site/) I followed to get set up.

All of this is done within Emacs.

The source is in the `/content` folder. The contents of this CAN be edited manually.

The static assets being served are in the `/docs` folder. These should NOT be edited manually. They are built using the `build.sh` script.
